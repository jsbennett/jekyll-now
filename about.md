Hey there! 

Thank you for stumbling to this small corner of the internet where my charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent are in full glory...

Okay so I may have slightly oversold myself... 

But anyway, this wee blog is all about me sharing my experinces from my time studying Computer Science at the Universiry of Dundee.

I hope I am able to bring an insight into this geeky experience with hopefully many laughs on the way!

Enjoy!

Until next time, 
Jay

## Heading Straight Into The Deep Deep .NET Ocean

### Introduction 
Hey Guys!

Before we dive into the third week, I just want to inform you of a wee format change. 
Since I am now working on my project at Craneware, it would be inappropriate to go into detail. With this consideration, instead of doing each week on a day to day basis, I will write just one big post at the end of the week. I will discuss what I have done without going into detail about the project and I promise I will still keep y'all in the loop with my time here at Craneware. With that in mind, here's what happened during my third week of my internship:

## Week 3
### Day 11 to Day 15 (18/06/18 - 22/06/18)
Week 3 has come and gone, and let me say, it has been a busy week! I spent most of the week completing the first task of my project. The first task threw many challenges my way. So let's get cracking!
  
  Generally, I had to create a deserialiser to deserialise information from a request. At the beginning of the week, I had no clue what serialisation and deserialisation was (Microsoft Word spelling: Serialization/deserialization but this feels like to me it's the American spelling so I'm just going to use the way I think it would be spelt. Plz drop me a wee message if it's not the correct way!) but now I know ALL about it. I'm practically dreaming about it. Anyhow, serialisation is the process in which an object is altered in such a way that it can be used in a stream. What I mean by this is that it can for example, be sent over a network or saved to memory. Deserialisation, if you haven't guessed is the opposite of this and turns serialised data into an object which can be manipulated in a way that you see fit. For more information, I found this to greatly help my understanding - <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/serialization-and-deserialization-in-c-sharp/ >
  
  Once I had absorbed this knowledge I jumped right in and created a deserialisation method. This was really putting my understanding to the test and I was successfully able to to create a fully functional method. However, I wanted this to be a generic method. If you don't know what a generic method is, well sit tight, it's time for me to try and explain it the best I can! So, when you are programming, you want your code to be as efficient and reusable as possible, and using generic classes and methods help to achieve this. For a class or method to be generic, this means that they are not bound to a specific data type. This means you can reuse the logic but use a different data type such as an integer or a string, or class type such as a car or bus type object. This is really useful since it helps reduce code duplication and encourages reusability! Result! 
  
  This week, I also got the opportunity to learn how to create C# classes from XML schemas. I knew what XML is, which is a standard way to represent data (For more information check this out: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13665671/is-xml-a-programming-language >) but I didnt realise that you can create classes from schemas! This saves development time by not having to manually create the classes, but it also means that each of the fields from an XML file will have the correct data type. I began by looking at the XSD command that Microsoft provide. This turned out to be exactly what I was looking for! If you'd like to see an example, check this out: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/xml-schema-def-tool-gen>
  
  So looking back on this week I've learnt and covered a lot. Before starting this internship, I was really unsure whether software development was a route for me. But I've started to realise that I more then enjoy the challenge, I live for the thrill of overcoming the problems and making sure that my code is the best solution. Even though learning new skills, new technologies and a new way of programming is an uphill battle to begin with, they will only make me a better developer in the long run. The more I become involved in Craneware and being a part of the bigger picture, the more I want to strive for my full potential. I can't believe that next week is my fourth week already! How time flies!
  
Anyway, until next time, 

Jay

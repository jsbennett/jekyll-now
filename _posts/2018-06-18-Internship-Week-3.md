## Heading Straight Into The Deep Deep .NET Ocean

### Introduction 
Hey Guys!

Before we dive into the third week, I just want to inform you of a wee format change. 
Since I am now working on my project at Craneware, I feel it would be inapproproate to go into detals. With this consideration, instead of doing each week on a day to day, I will write just one big post at the end of the week. I will discuss what I have done without going into detail about the project and I promise I will still keep y'all in the loop with my time here at Craneware. With that in mind, here's what happened during my third week of my internship:

## Week 3
### Day 11 to Day 15 (18/06/18 - 22/06/18)
Week 3 has come and gone, and let me say, it has been a busy week! I spent most of the week completing the first task of my project. The first task threw many challenges my way. So let's get cracking!
  
  Generally, I had to create a deserialiser to deserialise information from a request. At the beginning of the week, I had no clue what serialisation and deserialisation (Microsoft Word spelling: Serialization/deserialization but this feels like to me it's the American spelling so I'm just going to use the way I think it would be spelt. Plz drop me a wee message if it's not the correct way!) but now I know ALL about it. I'm practically dreaming about it. Anyhow, serialisation is the process in which an object is altered in such a way that it can be used in a stream. What I mean by this is that it can for example, be sent over a network or saved to memory. Deserialisation, if you haven't guessed is the opposite of this and turns serialised data into an object which can be manipulated in a way that you see fit. For more information, I found this to greatly help my understanding - <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/serialization-and-deserialization-in-c-sharp/>
    
    Once I had 
  
  //using schemas to make classes
  //wrote some unit tests 
  //talk about making deserialiser generic

## Still Trecking Away
## Introduction 
Howdy there! 

I can't believe at the end of this week I would have been at Craneware for four whole weeks! On the 4th of July, this will offically be the one month mark, so next week I'll slightly break tradition (again sorry) and add a mid-week review of the four weeks. Exciting huh! Without further ado, here is week 4 in all it's glory!

## Week 4
At the beginning of the week, I finally got TFS access! HURRAH!! TFS is the work management tool that Craneware use for each team. Finally having access means that I can finally commit the work I have been doing, have it reviewed and add my code to a real world product. Exciting huh? Once I had commited my changes, Vladimirs went about reviewing my work. 

As he was doing this, I got started on a new task. I started to learn about Entity Framework. Entity Framework huh? Never heard of it? SHOCKING! Well I'm going to be honest, neither have I so it's time I became an expert about it. I realise that I talk about me researching things but never actually talking about how I do that. I want to dive into the how because I think it's obvious what to google and what to look for, but from someone outwith a technical subject, they dont't really know what to google and what is the most important information to take from what they find. 

So here is a side story of how I came to realise this, you can skip if you don't care. I realised that people can not know what to google and what to look for when issues arrive from a courseowrk task at University. We had a masters student who had not done any computing work ever. We were tasked with creating a database and creating a website front end. We divided up the tasks and set off. Since she had not done any development work, she ran into issues early on and really struggled to find what she needed answers to. I helped by answering the ones I already knew how to fix and suggested for the harder ones, answers from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). When she came to find answers herself, she really didn't know what to look for so I broke it down how I go about doing it. And below is my process of researching for everything and anything I need to know: 

Well, first google becomes my best friend. This is the most obvious thing since it is a search engine and a no bad one at that. So to begin researching for

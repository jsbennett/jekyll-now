## Still Trecking Away
## Introduction 
Howdy there! I can't believe at the end of this week I would have been at Craneware for four whole weeks! On the 4th of July, this will offically be the one month mark, so next week I'll slightly break tradition (again sorry) and add a mid-week review of the four weeks. Exciting huh! Without further ado, here is week 4 in all it's glory!

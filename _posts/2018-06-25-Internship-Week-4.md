## Still Trecking Away
## Introduction 
Howdy there! 

I can't believe at the end of this week I would have been at Craneware for four whole weeks! On the 4th of July, this will offically be the one month mark, so next week I'll slightly break tradition (again sorry) and add a mid-week review of the four weeks. Exciting huh! Without further ado, here is week 4 in all it's glory!

## Week 4
At the beginning of the week, I finally got TFS access! HURRAH!! TFS is the work management tool that Craneware use for each team. Finally having access means that I can finally commit the work I have been doing, have it reviewed and add my code to a real world product. Exciting huh? Once I had commited my changes, Vladimirs went about reviewing my work. 

As he was doing this, I got started on a new task. I started to learn about Entity Framework. Entity Framework huh? Never heard of it? SHOCKING! Well I'm going to be honest, neither have I so it's time I became an expert about it. 

//learned about entity framework

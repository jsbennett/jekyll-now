Hey y'all, I know its been a while since my first post but here it is: post numéro deux! 

So, you may have connected the dots about what this post is about already but I am going to tell you anyway, it's all to do with connecting Ru Pauls Drag Race (a.k.a the greatest tv show ever, if you want reasons send me a message :P) and a hackathon. 

I will now try to answer the questions running through your head:


**1. Is Ru Pauls Drag Race really the best tv show ever though?**
Answer: Yes. No questions about it.


**2.How does the hackathon and the tv show relate?! Sooo confused!**
Answer: Ahhh, my sweet summer child, read on to find out. 


**3.But is it really the best?**
Answer: ◔_◔ yes.


So to start, the Dundee University Computer Society were organising a hackathon on the 11th of November 2017. Since Dundee University Computer Society initials are DUCS, they refered to the hackathon as a Quackathon (hahaaaaaaa). 
For those who do not know what a hackathon (I didn't until I went to one), it has nothing to do with hacking in the sense of illegal things i.e. hacking. 
Basically, a hackathon is where a group of people come together to hack something together wihtin a certain amount of time, i.e. to create something within 24 hours. 
So for the Quackathon, we had 24 hours and there were diferent challenges to choose from.

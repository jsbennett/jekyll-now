### Week 2

### Update (11/06/18) Day 6
First day back after the weekend and I'm ready to get going. We have finally moved out from the meeting room which was our home last week and moved onto the main floor. I'm lucky because the team I am working with sits directly behind me. This means I can annoy them more hahaha!! Anyway, today I started to learn about AngularJS. Since I have only slightly touched on JavaScript, I went back to basics and did online courses to get grips with it. I am looking forward to building up this skill as the weeks progressed. I also was able to take part in the team's standup. A standup is where the team come together for 15 minutes and talk about what they have done, if there are any issues and ways to overcome these. This was a really insightful experience to see it from an industry perspective, compared to trying it during coursework at University. 

### Update (11/06/18) Day 7
Today, I got stuck in and made a to do list using AngularJS. This allowed me to test my newly acquired skills and see where I should improve my knowledge. I then dived into understanding ASP.NET. This is interesting because I had always wanted to make time to understand how to work this but never got around to doing so. I also got the opportunity to attend a sprint retrospective. We got to be present in a mock one in University and I am really glad I got the opportunity to attend this one. I was able to gage a deeper understanding into how the team works and the processes in which they go through. 

### Update (12/06/18) Day 8
Midway through the second week and I have started to create a mock application in ASP.NET. I have found it difficult to get going in this, but I will persevere and make the best out of my lack of knowledge in this domain. I decided to make a mock website which is used to track what hot food is still hot. This allowed me to make progress in my knowledge of ASP.NET and how all the different components work. ASP.NET can follow the MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller). So how I have understood this is as follows (send me a message if I have understood incorrectly):
- The model is the knowledge for the project domain i.e. the data to be used and manipulated. 
- The view is for showing the model i.e how the data is displayed 
- The controller is for handling the user commands and translating them into commands for the view and model i.e. for example, a user clicks "show me price" button. The controller instructs the view how to display the price and tells the model to get the price to be displayed.

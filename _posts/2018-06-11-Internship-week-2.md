## And The Journey Has BEGUN!

Welcome back to my blog! Thank you for following along and I hope you are finding my intership experience at least a little bit interesting haha

Anyhow, we are now full steam ahead on week 2! So below are the updates for each day as they come.

### Week 2

### Update (11/06/18) Day 6
First day back after the weekend and I'm ready to get going. We have finally moved out from the meeting room which was our home last week and moved onto the main floor. I'm lucky because the team I am working with sits directly behind me. This means I can annoy them more hahaha!! Anyway, today I started to learn about AngularJS. Since I have only slightly touched on JavaScript, I went back to basics and did online courses to get grips with it. I am looking forward to building up this skill as the weeks progressed. I also was able to take part in the team's standup. A standup is where the team come together for 15 minutes and talk about what they have done, if there are any issues and ways to overcome these. This was a really insightful experience to see it from an industry perspective, compared to trying it during coursework at University. 

### Update (12/06/18) Day 7
Today, I got stuck in and made a to do list using AngularJS. This allowed me to test my newly acquired skills and see where I should improve my knowledge. I then dived into understanding ASP.NET. This is interesting because I had always wanted to make time to understand how to work this but never got around to doing so. I also got the opportunity to attend a sprint retrospective. We got to be present in a mock one in University and I am really glad I got the opportunity to attend this one. I was able to gage a deeper understanding into how the team works and the processes in which they go through. 

### Update (13/06/18) Day 8
Midway through the second week and I have started to create a mock application in ASP.NET. I have found it difficult to get going in this, but I will persevere and make the best out of my lack of knowledge in this domain. I decided to make a mock website which is used to track what hot food is still hot. This allowed me to make progress in my knowledge of ASP.NET and how all the different components work. ASP.NET can follow the MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller). So how I have understood this is as follows (send me a message if I have understood incorrectly):
- The model is the knowledge for the project domain i.e. the data to be used and manipulated. 
- The view is for showing the model i.e how the data is displayed 
- The controller is for handling the user commands and translating them into commands for the view and model i.e. for example, a user clicks "show me price" button. The controller instructs the view how to display the price and tells the model to get the price to be displayed.

### Update (14/06/18) Day 9
After spending yesterday getting to grips with ASP.NET, I continued some more on trying to create the webpage. I also dived into how routing works. From doing coursework at university, I had dabbled in this topic a little bit so being able to explore it some more was really useful. Routing allows you to naviagte to certain content on your website through the URLs e.g. <https://jsbennett.github.io/> is the homepage for this blog, but adding /about/ i.e <https://jsbennett.github.io/about/> retrieves and renders the about page. Being able to manage the different routes for the pages is important since you'd want the correct pages to be displayed. In ASP.NET, there is controllers which as mentioned before handle the model and view. The controller contains methods, known as actions, which are carried out depending on which request is sent i.e POST, GET etc. Routing allows the correct action to be carried out depending on the the request from the user. If you want to know exactly how ASP.NET does this, I found this page (<https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/785710/An-Absolute-Beginners-Tutorial-for-Understanding-A>) to be very useful in heloing my understanding and to actually be able to do it in my example application. 

### Update (15/06/18) Day 10
I can't believe we have reached the end of the second week already. Time seems to be flying by! Today my manager, Vladimirs, held a wee meeting where he explained what my first task was all about. I am really excited to get started and actually carry out my first piece of real world programming that will actually be used by a company and not just sitting on github looking pretty (If you can call it pretty). The first task is super interesting and is nothing like I have ever done before. I can't wait to develop these new skills and actually contribute something meaningful. Vladimirs also asked me to create a skills matrix which I have to keep up to date on what new skills I have gained from the internship! At the end of the 12 weeks, I will post a before and after of my skills and see the journey of my skills.

### Week 2 Conclusion

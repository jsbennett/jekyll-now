### Week 2

### Update (11/06/18) Day 6
First day back after the weekend and I'm ready to get going. We have finally moved out from the metting room which was our home last week, onto the main floor. I'm lucky because the team I am working with sits directly behind me. Means I can annoy them more hahaha!! Anyway, today I started to learn about AngularJS. Since I have only slightly touched on javascript, I went back to basics and did online courses to get grips with it. I am looking forward to building up this skill as the weeks progressed. I also was able to take part in the team's standup. A standup is where the team come together for 15 minutes and talk about what they have done, if there are any issues and ways to overcome these. This was a really insightful experience to see it from an industry perspective, compared to trying it during coursework at University. 

### Update (11/06/18) Day 7
Today, I got stuck in and made a to do list using AngularJS. This allowed me to test my newly acquired skills and see where I should improve my knowledge. I then dived into understanding ASP.NET. This is interesting because I had always wanted to make time to understand how to work this but never got round to doing so. I also got the opportunity to attend a sprint retrospective. We got to be present in a mock one in University and I am really glad I got the opportunity to attend this one. I was able to gage a deeper understanding into how the team works and the processes in which they go through.

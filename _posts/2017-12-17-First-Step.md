## This Is Just The Beginning

So this is my first blog post, I don't know how many people (if any) will read this but if you are I have something to say: hey there, welcome, can we be friends?! Nah jk (or am I...)

So, first of all my name is Jay and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the brilliant University of Dundee. If you don't have a clue what and where Dundee is, let me digress and teach you a fact or two about this cool little city. Fact number 1: Some call it Fundee because it's fun (I don't because it's not fun, okay maybe it's a little fun.) and 2: It's the sunniest city in Scotland (buuuuut that is just because I'm here hehehe). Anyway, Dundee is a really cool place to visit and be apart of so you should come and check it out sometime!

I wanted to create a blog to document my experince within the computing community and hopefully help a few folk out with my experince and my thoughts of my experience. I wish I had something to turn to in order to help me through stuff like getting my cv ready, programming problems, applying for internships etc etc. Since I have been unable to find such a useful resource, the world has been left me in charge of this responsibility to try and fill this gaping hole with as may 1's and 0's as I can. 

People often tend to assume that people interested in basically any STEM subject are anti-social, weird and don't have anything going for them other than being smart. And if people think that statement is true then they need to go and get their if-statement debugged (nice wee joke in there, c'mon I made you giggle at least? No? Maybe this is why I dont have friends...). In all seriousness(def. the quality or state of being serious), we are misunderstood, I dont think I've ever met a more social bunch than people from STEM subjects, and that's saying something because I have friends who are training to be primary teachers and we all know what they are like (For clarity: they party non stop and then wonder about why they haven't done their one essay they have had 3 months to complete... ok so maybe not all of them but you get the gist). There is more to being smart than knowledge and from my perspective, that something more, that wee extra byte, is what makes everyone ever who is associated with a STEM subject, put simply, brilliant. Not that I'm saying that non-STEM people aren't brilliant because they are exceptional people also, but that something that STEM has as a whole, gives us the opportunity to change the world in a way non-STEM folk can't through our very own art form. Yes, we are misunderstood, but that spark of creativity, knowledge, wisdom, logical thinking, weirdness and anti-socialness is what makes each and everyone one of us a unique and different breath of wind in the world. 

Okay so that paragraph above may sound like I'm trying to gather some Resistance fighters to fight The Empire (Star Wars reference for those not cool enough to be graced by this marvelous creation from George Lucas) but I'm trying to get the point across that us all in STEM are not what you think (unless you are one of us then in that case, yes, we are what you think). Any how, thank you for readinf this first blog! I plan on making more, with topics ranging from interviews, to what I find interesting in the technology sector and just other amazing stuff that I hope you come back to read them (Pleaaaaaassseeeeeeeee). 

Until next time,

dont RM -RF* anything whilst I'm away,

P.S. I was referred onto using a Jekyll blog by a very awesome friend (shout out to Conor) and if you also want to make a blog I would totally recommend going to this repository: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now make a fork and bam a website in minutes. Plus it's so cool.

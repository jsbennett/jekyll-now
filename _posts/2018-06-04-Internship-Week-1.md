## Exciting Journey About To Begin...

Hey there!

So first things first, this blog post and subsequent blog posts will be all about my experience from my summer internship at Craneware in the gorgeous city of Edinburgh. 

I plan on trying to update it daily or every few day on my morning commute but changes will be marked with "Update (Date)" so if you are coming back to read this then you know where I have added new items. 

### This Is The Begining

I am really excited to be starting my internship at Craneware. Craneware (<https://public.craneware.com/>) are the market leaders in providing software, tools and services for healthcare institutions used to improve and enhance their earnings.

From this internship I hope to gain new knowledge from the work I do and from everyone around me, an insight into this fast growing industry, new skills that will help me throughout my future career and studies, and to contribute a meaningful difference in the company. 

I have never embarked on a journey like this before, it's an exciting new plunge into the unknown and I am really looking forward to meeting everyone within the company. 

## Week 1

### Update 1 (4/6/18) Day 1

Hello there! 

So today is my first day and this is my first update! I am currently on my way to Ediburgh to start my first day. As I sit on the train and with each stop we get closer, I start to get more nervous but more excited to start. I can't wait to find out what will be instore for me!


Until next time, 

stay fierce, 

Jay

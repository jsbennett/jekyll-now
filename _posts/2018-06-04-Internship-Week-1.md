## Exciting Journey About To Begin...

Hey there!

So first things first, this blog post and subsequent blog posts will be all about my experience from my summer internship at Craneware in the gorgeous city of Edinburgh. 

I plan on trying to update it daily or every few day on my morning commute but changes will be marked with "Update (Date)" so if you are coming back to read this then you know where I have added new items. 

### This Is The Begining

I am really excited to be starting my internship at Craneware. Craneware (<https://public.craneware.com/>) are the market leaders in providing software tools and services for healthcare institutions used to improve and enhance their finances.

From this internship I hope to gain new knowledge from the work I do and from everyone around me, an insight into this fast growing industry, new skills that will help me throughout my future career and studies, and to contribute a meaningful difference in the company. 

I have never embarked on a journey like this before, it's an exciting new plunge into the unknown and I am really looking forward to meeting everyone within the company. 

## Week 1

The first week is all about getting to know the Craneware, how it works and about their products. This will provide a great understanding into how they operate, preparing us to take on more work when we start our roles. 

### Update (4/6/18) Day 1: Pre-arrival

Hello there! 

So today is my first day and this is my first update! I am currently on my way to Ediburgh to start my first day. As I sit on the train and with each stop we get closer, I start to get more nervous but more excited to start. I can't wait to find out what will be instore for me!

### Update (5/6/18) Day 1
Yesterday was a really great day! I got a great inisght into the company, it's products and it's staff including the important policies, procedures and laws that everyone in the company must follow. We even had pizza so for the first day, that was pretty good going. There are five other interns: three from Dundee University, one from Glasgow and one from Edinburgh. The staff are beyond helpful and really go out their way to make you feel welcomed. I can't see why I was even nervous in the first place! I am really excited to have this experience for the 12 weeks! Craneware prides itself on it's quality of their products they provide to their clients, knowing that they really make a difference in the world of healthcare. I can't wait to be apart of this. 

### Update (6/6/18) Day 2
So we got into even more interesting topics yesteday, covering stuff like devops, coding standards and even pool. Hopefully by the end of my time here at Craneware, I would have improved the most important skill: playing pool. Let me tell you right now, I can't play pool for the life of me so out of the seven attempts I had, I only potted one ball! I suppose a 14% sucess rate is not too shabby...

### Update (7/6/18) Day 3
Midweek blues? Hell no! We were lucky in that everyone we have met has been passionate about what they do within the company and that really shines through when they come to talk to us. We were shown the architecture of their cloud based product Trisus. This was particularly interesting because: 
1. I had never seen the pipeline of how such a service flows before
2. We got a great understanding of how all the components fit together and operate
3. It was good to see something a little bit more geeky that reading about policies and processes (sorry Cal!)
I am really looking forward to getting deeper technical knowledge about their products and for beginning some more work!

### Update (8/6/18) Day 4
Yesterday we were in for a treat. We spent the majority of the day working on a mock task given to us. We had to create a side menu which followed requirements given to us from UX. First we broke down and discussed the requirements themselves, trying to elaborate on what we should do. We learnt that we spent a little bit too much time trying to have the perfect plan, which left us with a few hours to actually start programming it. We split ourselves into two groups: HTML&CSS team and Javascript team. I decided to go onto the Javascript team since I had not done much in the way of Javascript, I wanted to dive more into this, and the best way to do so is to just do it! Once we started we had a couple of issues of trying to display the items but we soon fixed them. Although we did not get the menu finished, we still learnt a lot from it:
1. not spending too much of our time working on requirements at the beginning
2. understanding javascript and how it works
3. team working with like minded individuals 
4. understanding how to manage expectations
5. understanding how to take UX requirments and translating that into what we have to do
We all enjoyed this, it was a great team building excerise and I am looking forward to doing this more on a day to day basis.

Until next time, 

Jay

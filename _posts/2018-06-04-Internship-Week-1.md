## Exciting Journey About To Begin...

Hey there!

So first things first, this blog post and subsequent blog posts will be all about my experience from my summer internship at Craneware in the gorgeous city of Edinburgh. 

I plan on trying to update it daily or every few day on my morning commute but changes will be marked with "Update (Date)" so if you are coming back to read this then you know where I have added new items. 

### This Is The Begining

I am really excited to be starting my internship at Craneware. Craneware (<https://public.craneware.com/>) are the market leaders in providing software tools and services for healthcare institutions used to improve and enhance their finances.

From this internship I hope to gain new knowledge from the work I do and from everyone around me, an insight into this fast growing industry, new skills that will help me throughout my future career and studies, and to contribute a meaningful difference in the company. 

I have never embarked on a journey like this before, it's an exciting new plunge into the unknown and I am really looking forward to meeting everyone within the company. 

## Week 1

The first week is all about getting to know the company, how it works and about their products. This will provide a great understanding into how they operate, preparing us to take on more work when we start our roles. 

### Update (4/6/18) Day 1: Pre-arrival

Hello there! 

So today is my first day and this is my first update! I am currently on my way to Ediburgh to start my first day. As I sit on the train and with each stop we get closer, I start to get more nervous but more excited to start. I can't wait to find out what will be instore for me!

### Update (5/6/18) Day 1
Yesterday was a really great day! I got a great inisght into the company, it's products and it's staff including the important policies, procedures and laws that everyone in the company must follow. We even had pizza so for the first day, that was pretty good going. All the other interns are great and the staff are beyond helpful. I can't see why I was even nervous in the first place! I am really excited to have this experience for the 12 weeks! Craneware prides itself on it's quality of their products they provide to their clients, knowing that they really make a difference in the world of healthcare. I can't wait to be apart of this. 

### Update (6/6/18) Day 2
So we got into even more interesting topics yesteday, covering stuff like devops, coding standards and even pool. Hopefully by the end of my time here at Craneware, I would have improved the most important skill: playing pool. Let me tell you right now, I can't play pool for the life of me so out of the seven attempts I had, I only potted one ball! I suppose a 14% sucess rate is not too shabby. 

Until next time, 

stay fierce, 

Jay
